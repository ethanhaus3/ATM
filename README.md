# ATM
ATM Pin password code


small section of an ATM machine where you accept a string that is a password and accept it or reject it. If the user tries more than three times with a bad password the card is blocked and no password will be accepted until the resetFailedAttemptCounter method is called. The password is provided at creation of the AtmPin. Security is a priority!
